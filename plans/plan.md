# Need to review
- CV format
- LLM integration and cover letter generation
- Job sources
- Job scoring
- Web UI

## CV Format
- Should entries be shorter? Should the CV take less than one page?
- Is there a better way to display skills? What about technologies/skills for each entry?

**If we are fine with entries of this length**, I think we should actually:
1. Have one file per entry...


## LLM integration and cover letter generation

## Job scoring
- Make locations configurable as well. Maybe differentiate between locations in spanish and in english?
- Locations like "MD" or "ES" are not matched – maybe the only solution is to add these to the location list, but I'd also like to make it more robust e.g. by ensuring that the scraper returns locations in a standard format.

## Web UI
- Update cron button is too large (see [screenshot](Screenshot 2026-02-09 at 10.26.18.png))
- "Jobs" navigation link takes to a page with just the jobs table, without any navigation links or filters
- Improve logs maybe?
- In the homepage, Job status column is too narrow and can't see the job status properly
